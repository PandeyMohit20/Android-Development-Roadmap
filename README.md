# ROADMAP OF ANDROID DEVELOPMENT

Pick a Language

Although, you can use both Kotlin and Java to develop native android apps, Google announced in 2019 to make Kotlin the preferred way of developing android applications. If you were to start learning android development today, Kotlin should be your language of choice.



The Fundamentals

Install the Android Studio and learn the basics of Kotlin to get started.

Version Control Systems

Version control systems record your changes to the codebase and allow you to recall specific versions later. There are multiple Version Control Systems available but Git is the most common one these days.
